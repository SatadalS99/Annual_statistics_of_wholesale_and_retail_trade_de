# Trade and Economic Activity in Germany, 2005–2020

# Overview
This project analyzes official business statistics in Germany from 2005 to 2020, focusing on enterprises, employment, turnover, and economic activity in the trade sector. It highlights structural changes, productivity differences, and the sector’s resilience during economic shifts.


# Research Questions
1.  Labour Productivity –
     How does turnover per employee vary across trade activities, and what does this suggest about productivity differences between labour-intensive and capital-intensive sectors?
2.  Capital Investment –
     What is the relationship between gross capital formation and turnover across activities, and does higher investment consistently lead to stronger revenue growth?
3.  Structural Change –
     Has there been consolidation in the trade sector, with fewer but larger enterprises, and how has this influenced employment and turnover?
4.  Expenditure vs. Turnover –
     How does expenditure (e.g., input of goods, operating costs) correlate with turnover, and are some sub-sectors more efficient in converting inputs into revenue?
