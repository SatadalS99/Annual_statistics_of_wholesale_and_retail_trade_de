# Trade and Economic Activity in Germany, 2005–2020

# Overview
This project analyzes German trade statistics from 2005–2020, focusing on productivity, capital investment, structural change, and expenditure efficiency. It explores how enterprises, employment, and turnover interact across wholesale, retail, and motor vehicle sectors.


# Research Questions
1.  Labour Productivity –
     How does turnover per employee vary across trade activities, and what does this suggest about productivity differences between labour-intensive and capital-intensive sectors?
2.  Capital Investment –
     What is the relationship between gross capital formation and turnover across activities, and does higher investment consistently lead to stronger revenue growth?
3.  Structural Change –
     Has there been consolidation in the trade sector, with fewer but larger enterprises, and how has this influenced employment and turnover?
4.  Expenditure vs. Turnover –
     How does expenditure (e.g., input of goods, operating costs) correlate with turnover, and are some sub-sectors more efficient in converting inputs into revenue?
